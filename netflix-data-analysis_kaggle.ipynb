It is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award winning TV shows , movies , anime , documentaries and much more on thousands of internet-connected devices. It lets its users to have access to the best of movies and shows on a single platform for a very reasonable price. Netflix gained its popularity particulary during the covid-19 period, when people found a source of entertainment in it.\n\nFor this project, we are going to use a dataset of all the movies and Tv shows that are available on netflix. This data was acquired in May 2022 containing data available in the United States. This dataset is in .csv format titled (titles.csv).By analyzing these dataset, we will try to understand which type of movies and shows does netflix offers , which countries provides the most content , how many releases were recorded in each year since the 1940s , which movies had the best imdb ratings and which are the most common genres on netflix.  \n\nDataset source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies\n\nThe tools that are used for analysis are:\n\n* Pandas\n* Numpy\n* Matplotlib\n* Seaborn\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies/titles.csv'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.793814Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.794349Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.817854Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.794230Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.816810Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install required libraries\nFirst we install all the libraries of python that are used in this analysis and then import them in our notebook.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.819577Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.820418Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-29T16:37:18.368880Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-29T16:37:17.820383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-29T16:37:18.367546Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Downloading the Dataset\n\n We have downloaded and uploaded the titles.csv and credits.csv files on our jupyter notebook.

The dataset contained all necessary information of all the movies and TV shows that are available on netflix platform. We analyzed it based on various categories like genre, release year, age certification , type and runtime.

There are approximately 5000+ different movies/shows that netflix provides, all those which released in between the period of 1940s to the current year.\n\n* A total of 97 different countries contribute the best of their content to netflix. A few of the top contributors being U.S.A   ,India , U.K and Japan. infact, U.S.A alone contributes about 38% of the total content available on netflix. No wonder      Hollywood is such a big industry.\n\n* Netflix offers total 19 different genres of movies and shows to choose from. Most famous of them being 'Drama' and 'Comedy' which constitutes for more than 2300 titles on netflix. The least famous genre appears to be 'western' and 'war'.

More than 800 shows/Movies falls under the 'TV-MA' category , which allows only adults to watch. About 600 shows/movies are R-Rated(Restricted), which only allows children under 17 to watch under the supervision of their parents/guardian. Only a handful of shows/movies are rated 'NC-17', which strictly prohibits under-17 children from watching.\n\n* There were only a handful of movies and shows that had released from the 1940 s to up until 2010. It was only after 2011 that the film and TV industry started producing enough content. More than 800 movies/shows were released in the period between 2019 - 2020, and about 700 in the year 2018 and 2022.\n\n* We also compared the average imdb ratings and tmdb popularity of 'Movie' and 'show'. Turns out, shows on netflix are more popular among the people than movies.\n\n* The average runtime of a movie on netflix is about 100 minutes , whereas the average runtime of a show is nearly 40 minutes.\n\n* Most Tv shows runs only a single season, a few hundreds of them extends upto 2,3 or 4 seasons. One particular show named 'Survivors' made a total of 42 seasons which is the most for any show on netflix.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Work\n\nIn addition to this data, we can merge another dataset containing the information about the cast and directors who worked in the films and shows. We can then analyze which actors appears the most on the screen and which directors has the highest success rate in the film and tv industry.\n\n\n## References\n\nFollowing are the resources that have been used in this analysis for data set and tools :-\n\n* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies\n* Pandas guide: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html\n* Matplotlib guide: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.1/users/index.html\n* Seaborn guide & tutorial: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
