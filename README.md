Implemented a small-scale analysis on the dataset of Netflix, containing all the 
details of movies/shows that are available on the Netflix streaming platform. Used 
python and its various libraries like Pandas, NumPy,  Seaborn and matplotlib to extract, 
analyze and visualize the given data which could be further used for consumer
